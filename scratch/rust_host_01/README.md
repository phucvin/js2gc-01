# Rust Host for Compiler Output

This project is a Rust host using `wasmtime` to execute WebAssembly modules generated by the compiler.

## Prerequisites

- Rust (cargo)
- Wasmtime

## Build

```bash
cargo build
```

## Usage

```bash
cargo run -- <path-to-wasm-file>
```

The Wasm file must be generated by the compiler (which exports `main` and expects specific `env` imports).
