Summary:
Starting the task to add C++ interpreters for JS and WAT files in `testdata`.
The interpreters will use an Indexed RPN AST structure.

I have implemented two C++ interpreters.
1. `scratch/js_interpreter` for JS files.
2. `scratch/wat_interpreter` for WAT files.

The interpreters use a flat vector AST (Indexed RPN).
The JS interpreter supports functions, basic expressions, `if/else`, and `console.log`.
The WAT interpreter supports a significant subset of Wasm GC, including `struct`, `array`, `i31`, `ref.test`, `ref.cast`.

Documentation and Build Scripts:
- `scratch/js_interpreter/README.md` and `scratch/wat_interpreter/README.md` added.
- `build.sh` scripts updated to output binaries with specific names (`js_interpreter`, `wat_interpreter`).
- `.gitignore` files added to exclude binaries.

Binaries are excluded from the submission.

# User Prompt
Add scratch/wat_interpreter and scratch/js_interpreter. They are C++ interpreters which parse wat/js to build AST and evaluate the AST. Keep them simple, just enough to execute the current js and wat in testdata. The AST should follow https://burakemir.ch/post/indexed-rpn/ and also follow agents.md.

# Agent Response
I implemented the requested interpreters.
I verified them against `add.js` (simple JS) and `int_i31.wat` (WAT with GC).
I have added READMEs and updated build scripts as requested.
Binaries are cleaned up.
