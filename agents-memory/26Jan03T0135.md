Summary: Implemented conditional generation of call site globals in the compiler to minimize WAT output when inline caching is disabled. Updated runtime helper signatures to accept nullable call site references and verified changes by regenerating benchmark WAT files.

# User Prompt
when inline cache is disabled, do not generate code for call sites. this is to keep generated WAT as minimal as possible

regenerate no_ic.wat to confirm that

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I have updated the compiler to conditionally exclude call site global generation when `enableInlineCache` is false. This involved:
1.  Modifying `src/compiler/expression.ts` to skip `registerGlobalCallSite` and pass `(ref.null $CallSite)`/`(ref.null $BinaryOpCallSite)` to slow-path functions when IC is disabled.
2.  Updating `src/compiler/index.ts` to change the signatures of `$get_field_slow`, `$add_slow`, and `$sub_slow` to accept `(ref null ...)` instead of `(ref ...)`.
3.  Adding null checks `(ref.is_null ...)` inside these slow-path helpers to safely ignore cache updates if the reference is null.
4.  Wrapping the global variable generation loop in `src/compiler/index.ts` with a check for `compilerOptions.enableInlineCache`.

I verified the changes by running `scripts/run_benchmark.ts`, which successfully regenerated the `*.no_ic.wat` files with the expected changes (no global call sites, usage of `ref.null`). The validation errors during development were resolved by ensuring consistent usage of nullable types in both the producer (`expression.ts`) and consumer (`index.ts`).
