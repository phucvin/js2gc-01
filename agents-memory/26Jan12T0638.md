Summary: Implemented `br_on_cast` optimization for `$console_log` in `src/compiler/index.ts`. Updated `docs/potential-optimizations-01.md`. Verified with `testdata/console_log_optimization.js` and other tests.

# User Prompt
implement one any possible optimization in docs/

# Agent Response
I chose to implement "Optimize Type Checks with `br_on_cast`" (Runtime #4) for the `$console_log` function.
I rewrote `$console_log` in `src/compiler/index.ts` to use a chain of `br_on_cast` instructions inside nested blocks, replacing the previous cascade of `ref.test` + `if` + `ref.cast`.
I created `testdata/console_log_optimization.js` to verify the behavior for all handled types (null, i31, BoxedI32, BoxedF64, String, Object).
I verified that all tests pass, including the new test case.
I updated `docs/potential-optimizations-01.md` to reflect that this optimization is implemented for `$console_log`.
