Summary: Update benchmark setup to include fib(40) and a new field access benchmark. Modify runner to print all run durations and avoid writing .out files.

# User Prompt
update benchmark to:

fib with fib(40)

add benchmark for field access in a big loop

run & print duration for each target 5 times, but conclude the ratio using the min of both

no need to write to .out file

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I will update the benchmark setup.
1. Update `fib.js` to calculate `fib(40)`.
2. Create `field_access.js` to benchmark field access in a loop.
3. Update `scripts/run_benchmark.ts` to:
    - Run 5 times and print duration for each run.
    - Use min for ratio calculation.
    - Remove writing to `.out` files.
