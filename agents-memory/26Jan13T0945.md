# Agent Response
I will execute the tasks in `docs/improvements-01.md`, excluding section 2. I have established a plan to:
1. Initialize memory.
2. Implement shared utilities.
3. Setup linting and formatting.
4. Refactor compiler (extract runtime, modularize AST).
5. Implement shared runtime module strategy.
6. Add documentation.
7. Add CI/CD.
8. Improve WAT generation.
