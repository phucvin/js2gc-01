# Agent Response

I updated `scripts/run_benchmark.ts` to execute both Wasm and JS versions of the benchmark 5 times, taking the minimum duration for comparison.
I ran the benchmark (fib.js) and found Wasm to be ~10x faster.
I added a "Benchmarks" section to `README.md` with the instructions and the latest output.
