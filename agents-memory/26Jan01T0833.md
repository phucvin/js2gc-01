Summary: Initial setup for JS to WAT compiler (Wasm GC + stringref).

# User Prompt
add basic structure for the compiler that can compile js to WAT using Wasm GC and stringref, but not Wasm linear memory

keep it very simple now, support only a main function that can return a number or a string literal

test the compiler by having test js files in testdata folder. a test script to scan and compile to WAT, write the WAT to .wat file, then use binayen to convert the WAT to Wasm, and run with node, write the output to .out file

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I will start by setting up the project structure and the memory file.
