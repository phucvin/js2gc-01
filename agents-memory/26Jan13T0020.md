Summary: Rerun benchmark `scripts/run_benchmark.ts` and updated `README.md`. Verified that `run_benchmark_with_wasmtime.py` and `run_benchmark_with_wat_interpreter.py` are missing.

# User Prompt
rerun benchmark

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I have rerun the benchmarks using `scripts/run_benchmark.ts`.
This updated `README.md` with the latest performance numbers for JS and Wasm (IC vs No IC).

I attempted to run the python-based benchmark scripts mentioned in my memory (`scripts/run_benchmark_with_wat_interpreter.py` and `scripts/run_benchmark_with_wasmtime.py`) but they were not found in the repository, so I proceeded with the available Node.js-based benchmark runner.

I also verified the build of `scratch/wat_interpreter` was successful, though I couldn't run its specific benchmark script.
