Summary: Added `dynamic_03.wat` to demonstrate inline caching with hidden classes.

# User Prompt

add dynamic_03 to show how would inline caching can help field access

# Agent Response

I created `scratch/use_wat/dynamic_03.wat` which implements a hidden class (Shape) object model and an inline cache mechanism.

- Defined `$Shape` struct (transition tree) and `$Object` struct (shape + storage).
- Defined `$CallSite` struct to hold `$expected_shape` and `$offset`.
- Implemented `$get_field_cached` which checks `object.shape == cache.expected_shape`. If equal, it performs a direct array access (fast path). If not, it falls back to a slow lookup and updates the cache.
- Demonstrated the mechanism in `$main` by creating an object, a call site, and accessing a property twice (miss then hit).
- Verified the implementation by running `scratch/use_wat/run.ts` with `--experimental-wasm-stringref`.
