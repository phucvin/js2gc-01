Summary: Created `scratch/rust_host_01` (Rust/wasmtime host) and updated compiler to support `disableStrings`.

# Agent Response
I have implemented `scratch/rust_host_01` using `wasmtime` to execute Wasm files generated by the project's compiler.

**Key Changes:**
1.  **New Rust Project**: Created `scratch/rust_host_01` with `wasmtime` dependency.
    -   Host implements imports for `print_i32`, `print_f64`, and `print_string`.
    -   Configures `wasmtime` engine with `wasm_gc` and `wasm_function_references` features enabled.
    -   **Constraint**: The available `wasmtime` version (40.0.0 in environment) does not support the Wasm `stringref` proposal (`HeapType::String` is missing). To handle this, I updated the compiler to allow disabling stringref features.
2.  **Compiler Updates**:
    -   Updated `src/compiler/context.ts` and `src/compiler/index.ts` to accept a `disableStrings` option.
    -   When `disableStrings` is true, the compiler omits `(ref string)` types and `string.*` instructions, using a simplified `console.log` implementation that only handles numbers.
3.  **Tooling**:
    -   Created `scripts/compile_one.ts` to easily compile a single JS file to WAT, supporting a `--disable-strings` flag.

**Verification**:
-   Verified that a simple test script (printing an integer) compiles and runs successfully using the new Rust host.
-   Confirmed that `stringref` usage causes validation errors in `wasmtime` if enabled, justifying the fallback approach.
