Summary: Modify compiler pipeline to include Binaryen roundtrip validation without optimization.

# User Prompt

validate wat (but do not optimize) and do roundtrip through binaryen before return final wat

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response

I will modify `src/compiler/index.ts` to import `binaryen`, parse the generated WAT, validate it, and emit the canonicalized WAT. I will explicitly skip optimization as requested.
