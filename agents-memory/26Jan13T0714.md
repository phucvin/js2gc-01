Summary: Optimized `$add_slow` and `$sub_slow` runtime helpers in `src/compiler/index.ts` by replacing `call $get_type_id` and `if/else` chains with `br_on_cast_fail` nested blocks. This optimizes type checking for binary operators. Handled stack management for `br_on_cast_fail` (dropping fallthrough values). Verified with `scripts/run_testdata.ts` and debugged validation errors using temporary reproduction scripts.

# Agent Response

I will implement "Optimize Type Checks with `br_on_cast`" for `$add_slow` and `$sub_slow` in `src/compiler/index.ts`.
This involves refactoring the functions to use `br_on_cast_fail` (or `br_on_cast`) for type dispatch instead of calling `$get_type_id` and using `if` chains.
