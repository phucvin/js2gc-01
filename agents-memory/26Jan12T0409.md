Summary: Reran benchmarks for `fib.js` and `field_access.js`, updated README.md with new results showing significant Wasm speedup for Fibonacci but overhead for simple field access.

# User Prompt
rerun benchmark

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I will rerun the benchmark by building and executing the `bench_runner.js`. I will also ensure I follow the memory recording protocols defined in `AGENTS.md`.

## Actions Taken
1.  **Initialized Memory Recording**: Created `agents-memory/26Jan12T0409.md` to log this session.
2.  **Environment Setup**: Ran `npm install` to ensure dependencies were up to date.
3.  **Built Benchmark Runner**: Executed `node scripts/build_benchmark.js` to create the standalone `bench_runner.js`.
4.  **Executed Benchmarks**: Ran `node bench_runner.js`, which executed the benchmarks (`fib.js`, `field_access.js`) and updated `README.md`.
5.  **Verified Tests**: Ran `scripts/run_testdata.ts` to ensure no regressions in the compiler or runtime.

## Benchmark Results
-   `fib.js`: Wasm implementation is ~10x faster than JS.
-   `field_access.js`: Wasm implementation is slower (4x-6x) due to the overhead of the current implementation (likely inline caching or function call overhead for simple operations).

## Verification
-   Verified that `README.md` was updated with the new table.
-   Verified that `benchmark/` directory contains the generated `.wasm` and `.wat` files.
-   Ran `scripts/run_testdata.ts` and confirmed all 21 examples passed.
