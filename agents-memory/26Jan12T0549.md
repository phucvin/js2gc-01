# Agent Response

I have combined `docs/potential-optimizations-02.md` and `docs/potential-optimizations-03.md` into `docs/potential-optimizations-01.md`, deduplicating items and organizing them into "Runtime Optimizations" and "Compiler / Code Generation Optimizations". I preserved notes about partially implemented features. I then deleted the obsolete files.
