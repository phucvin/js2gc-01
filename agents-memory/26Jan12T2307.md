Summary: Implemented support for JavaScript prototype inheritance.
- Modified `$Object` struct to include `$proto` field.
- Updated `$new_object` to accept prototype argument.
- Updated `$get_field_resolve` to traverse prototype chain.
- Updated `$Closure` struct to inherit from `$Object` and include prototype field.
- Implemented `NewExpression` compilation logic in `expression.ts`, including:
  - Constructor evaluation.
  - Prototype retrieval.
  - Object creation with prototype.
  - Constructor call with `this`.
- Updated `compileFunctionExpression` to initialize function objects with a `prototype` property.
- Verified with `testdata/prototype.js` which confirms prototype method access and instance field access.

# User Prompt
support prototype

# Agent Response
I have implemented prototype support in the compiler.
This involved:
1.  Updating the Wasm object model to support a prototype chain (`$proto` field).
2.  Updating property lookup logic (`$get_field_resolve`) to traverse the prototype chain.
3.  Implementing `new` operator support (`ts.NewExpression`).
4.  Ensuring function closures are initialized as objects with a `prototype` property.

Verified with `testdata/prototype.js`:
```javascript
function main() {
  let Person = function(val) {
    this.val = val;
  };
  Person.prototype.getVal = function() {
    return this.val;
  };
  
  let p = new Person(100);
  console.log(p.getVal()); // Outputs: 100
}
```
All tests passed.
