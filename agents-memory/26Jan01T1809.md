Summary: Add dynamic_04.wat to demo inline caching for add operator between 2 dynamic objects (i32, f64, mixed).

# User Prompt
add dynamic_04 to demo inline caching for add operator between 2 dynamic object

they can be i32 or f64 or mixed, and the add logic is different for each case

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I will create `scratch/use_wat/dynamic_04.wat`.
This file will define a dynamic object system where objects can hold i32 or f64 values.
I will implement an `add` function that uses inline caching to optimize the addition based on the types of the two operands.
The cache will store the shapes of the left and right operands and the specialized addition function.
I will also verify the implementation by running it with the existing test runner.
