Summary:
Implemented "Reuse Loaded Shape" optimization in the inline cache mechanism to avoid redundant shape loads in the slow path.
Refactored `$get_field_slow` in `src/compiler/index.ts` to delegate to a new `$get_field_resolve` helper that accepts an explicit shape argument.
Updated `src/compiler/index.ts` to implement `$get_field_cached` passing the locally loaded shape to `$get_field_resolve`.
Updated `docs/potential-optimizations-01.md` to mark "Reuse Loaded Shape" as Implemented.
Verified changes by running `scripts/run_testdata.ts` (all 22 examples passed).

# Agent Response

I have implemented the **Reuse Loaded Shape** optimization described in `docs/potential-optimizations-01.md`.

### Changes Implemented:

1.  **Refactored `$get_field_slow`**: Created a new internal helper `$get_field_resolve` (taking `$obj`, `$shape`, `$key`) that performs the actual lookup. `$get_field_slow` now wraps this helper, loading the shape first.
2.  **Optimized `$get_field_cached`**: In the inline cache logic, the object's shape is already loaded for comparison. I modified the code to save this shape to a local variable and pass it directly to `$get_field_resolve` in the fallback path, avoiding a redundant `struct.get` operation.
3.  **Updated Documentation**: Marked "Reuse Loaded Shape" as **Implemented** in `docs/potential-optimizations-01.md`.

### Verification:

Ran `scripts/run_testdata.ts` and confirmed that all 22 test examples pass successfully, ensuring no regressions.

```bash
npx ts-node scripts/run_testdata.ts
...
All examples processed successfully!
```
