# Agent Response
I have run the examples in `scratch/use_binaryen_api` and `scratch/use_wat`.
- `scratch/use_binaryen_api`: Ran `run.ts` which executed all `.ts` examples and generated `.out` files.
- `scratch/use_wat`: Ran `run.ts` (via compiled JS to enable `--experimental-wasm-stringref`) which parsed, optimized, and executed all `.wat` examples, generating `.optimized` and `.out` files.

I encountered a minor issue running the WAT examples directly with `ts-node` due to the need for experimental stringref support, so I compiled the runner to JS and ran it with `node --experimental-wasm-stringref`.
