Summary: Implemented Wasm GC examples for subtyping, polymorphism, and closures, verifying them with Binaryen.

# User Prompt

read https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/blob/main/proposals/gc/Overview.md

and add more wat examples to show how sub-typing, polymorphism, cloudure would look like and work

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response

I read the GC proposal overview and implemented three new WAT examples in `wat_examples/`:

1.  `subtyping.wat`: Demonstrates structural subtyping with explicit `(sub ...)` declarations.
2.  `polymorphism.wat`: Demonstrates using `anyref` and `i31ref` for boxing/unboxing and casting.
3.  `closures.wat`: Demonstrates closures using structs to capture environments, utilizing `(rec ...)` for recursive type definitions.

I verified these examples by running the provided `wat_examples/run.ts` script, ensuring they compile, optimize, and execute correctly with `binaryen`.
