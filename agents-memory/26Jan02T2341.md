# Agent Response
I updated `benchmark/fib.js` to calculate `fib(30)` instead of `fib(40)`.

I then modified `scripts/run_benchmark.ts` to support running in a jitless environment. Since Node.js with `--jitless` disables WebAssembly, I updated the script to:
1.  Check for the existence of `WebAssembly` before attempting compilation or execution of Wasm.
2.  Dynamically import `binaryen` only when needed and safe, preventing crashes at startup when `binaryen.js` tries to initialize Wasm.
3.  Report Wasm results as "N/A" if Wasm is unavailable.

I executed the benchmark using a bundled script (to bypass `ts-node` issues in jitless mode) with `node --jitless`. The results showed `fib(30)` taking ~580ms in jitless JS, compared to <10ms in standard JIT JS (inferred from `fib(40)` baseline).

I cleaned up the temporary build artifacts (`bench_jitless.js`, `build_jitless.js`, `mock_binaryen.js`) and updated `README.md` with the new benchmark results, removing the old table to avoid confusion.

I verified the changes by running the test suite `scripts/run_testdata.ts`, which passed successfully.
