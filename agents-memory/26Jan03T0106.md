Summary: Updated automation scripts to output compiled `.wasm` files.

# User Prompt
update run_testdata and run_benchmark to also write compiled wasm to .wasm file

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I updated `scripts/run_testdata.ts` and `scripts/run_benchmark.ts` to write the compiled Wasm binary to a `.wasm` file in the same directory as the source file.
I also updated `.gitignore` to ignore `*.wasm` files to prevent accidental commits of binary artifacts.
I used strict regex replacement for file extensions in the scripts to improve robustness.
Verified the changes by running the scripts and checking for the existence of `.wasm` files.
