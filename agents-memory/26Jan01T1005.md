Summary: Starting implementation of anyref return types and boxing for compiled functions.

# User Prompt
compiled wat functions should always return anyref

if a double, boxed it in BoxedF64 struct

if an integer, convert to i31ref if possible, or boxed it in BoxedI32 struct

if a string, boxed it in BoxedString struct with stringref field

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I will implement the requested changes in `src/compiler.ts`. I will also update the test runner if necessary to handle `anyref` returns.
