Summary: Initialized session to analyze WAT files for advanced optimizations. Analyzed `testdata/*.wat` and identified opportunities including `br_on_cast`, constant string deduplication, `array.new_data`, and better type management. Documented findings in `docs/potential-optimizations-03.md`.

# User Prompt

read all wat files in testdata to identify more potential optimizations, including advanced ones

write the detailed findings into docs/potential-optimizations-03.md

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response

I have analyzed the `.wat` files in `testdata/` and identified several advanced optimization opportunities.
I have documented these findings in `docs/potential-optimizations-03.md`.
The key findings include:

1.  Using `br_on_cast` to combine type checks and casting.
2.  Deduplicating constant strings to reduce allocation.
3.  Using `array.new_data` for more compact string initialization.
4.  Optimizing redundant memory accesses in Inline Cache logic.
5.  Reducing redundant `ref.as_non_null` casts.
