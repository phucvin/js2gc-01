# Agent Response
I created `scripts/run_testdata_with_js_interpreter.py` which iterates over `.js` files in `testdata`, executes them using `scratch/js_interpreter/js_interpreter`, and compares the output with `.out` files.
I built the `js_interpreter` binary to verify the script.
I updated `scratch/js_interpreter/README.md` to include instructions for running the test data using the new script.
I verified the script runs (13 passed, 6 failed due to output differences which are expected/out of scope for this task).
