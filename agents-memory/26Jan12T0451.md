Summary: Updated potential optimization docs to reflect that `drop (ref.null none)` is partially mitigated by `dropResult`.

# User Prompt

update potential optimizations docs to reflect the current state, since some of them might be already implemented

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response

I identified that the "Redundant Instructions (`drop (ref.null none)`)" optimization is partially implemented in `src/compiler/expression.ts` and `src/compiler/statement.ts` via `dropResult` propagation.
I am updating `docs/potential-optimizations-02.md` to reflect this.
I also verified that logical operators `&&` and `||` are not yet supported, and other optimizations (inline cache short-circuiting, etc.) are still open.
