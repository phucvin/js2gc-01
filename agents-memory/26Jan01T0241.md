Summary: Setup Binaryen.js with TypeScript examples for Wasm GC.

# User Prompt
add binaryen.js and write some examples to produce WAT files that uses Wasm GC, also run the examples generated Wasm using and record the output to a corresponding file

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I planned to initialize a Node.js project, create Javascript examples for Struct and Array GC types using Binaryen, run them to generate WAT and output files, and follow the AGENTS.md logging requirements.

# User Prompt
use typescript

put these examples under binaryen_api_examples with a readme

have a script to scan and run those api examples automatically

also mention the script in the readme

# Agent Response
I updated the plan to use TypeScript.
I created a directory `binaryen_api_examples`.
I implemented `gc_struct.ts` and `gc_array.ts` using `binaryen.parseText` (as the API constructor was unstable for GC types) to successfully parse, compile, and run Wasm GC modules.
I created `run_all.ts` to automatically execute these examples.
I added a `README.md` with instructions.
I verified the outputs (`.wat` and `.out` files) were correct.
