Summary: Setup Binaryen.js with TypeScript examples for Wasm GC.

# User Prompt
add binaryen.js and write some examples to produce WAT files that uses Wasm GC, also run the examples generated Wasm using and record the output to a corresponding file

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I planned to initialize a Node.js project, create Javascript examples for Struct and Array GC types using Binaryen, run them to generate WAT and output files, and follow the AGENTS.md logging requirements.

# User Prompt
use typescript

put these examples under binaryen_api_examples with a readme

have a script to scan and run those api examples automatically

also mention the script in the readme

# Agent Response
I updated the plan to use TypeScript.
I created a directory `binaryen_api_examples`.
I implemented `gc_struct.ts` and `gc_array.ts` using `binaryen.parseText` (as the API constructor was unstable for GC types) to successfully parse, compile, and run Wasm GC modules.
I created `run_all.ts` to automatically execute these examples.
I added a `README.md` with instructions.
I verified the outputs (`.wat` and `.out` files) were correct.

# User Prompt
refactor binaryen api examples:

rename the folder to wat_examples

have .wat files containing the example (e.g
struct, array, no gc prefix)

the run script then scan and parse all WAT files, optimize and write to .wat.optimized files, run the Wasm module by calling its main function and write the output i32 to .out file

update readme to reflect what is being done here

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I refactored the examples as requested.
- Renamed `binaryen_api_examples` to `wat_examples`.
- Extracted the WAT content from the previous TS files into `array.wat` and `struct.wat`.
- Standardized the examples to export a `main` function.
- Created `wat_examples/run.ts` which scans `.wat` files, uses `binaryen.parseText` to load them, optimizes them, writes the optimized WAT to `*.optimized.wat`, compiles and runs them, and saves the output to `*.out`.
- Updated `wat_examples/README.md`.
- Verified everything works by running the script.
