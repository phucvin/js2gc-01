Summary: Optimized the compiler by removing unnecessary `ref.as_non_null` casts before `struct.get` and `call_ref` instructions. Verified that these instructions implicitly trap on null references. Fixed a regression where `ref.as_non_null` was incorrectly removed for arguments passed to `$set_storage`.

# User Prompt
try to remove unnecessary ref.as_non_null

# Agent Response
I identified that `ref.as_non_null` is redundant before `struct.get` and `call_ref` instructions in WebAssembly GC because these instructions implicitly trap on null references.

I modified `src/compiler/expression.ts` and `src/compiler/index.ts` to remove these redundant casts.

During testing, I discovered a regression where `ref.as_non_null` was removed from arguments passed to `$set_storage`, which requires a non-nullable reference. I fixed this by restoring the cast for `objAccess` and `envAccess` where applicable.

I verified the changes by:
1. Creating temporary WAT files to confirm that `struct.get` and `call_ref` accept nullable references and validate correctly.
2. Running `scripts/run_testdata.ts` to ensure no regressions in the test suite.
3. Running `scripts/run_benchmark.ts` to verify performance improvements.

The changes were submitted to the `remove-unnecessary-ref-as-non-null` branch.
