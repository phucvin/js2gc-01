Summary: Renamed simple_oop to dynamic_01 and added dynamic_02 (i32 keys)

# User Prompt

rename simple_oop to dynamic_01

add another example like that, called dynamic_02, but use i32 as key for objects, since string keys in a dynamic language can be symbolized to i32 to be shorter

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response

I have renamed `scratch/use_wat/simple_oop.wat` (and its artifacts) to `scratch/use_wat/dynamic_01.wat`.
I have also created `scratch/use_wat/dynamic_02.wat`, which uses `i32` for property keys instead of `stringref`, mimicking symbolized keys in a dynamic language.
I verified both examples by running `scratch/use_wat/run.ts` and confirmed they execute correctly.
Artifacts (`.optimized` and `.out`) for both examples have been committed.
