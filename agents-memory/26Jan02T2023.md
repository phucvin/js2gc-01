Summary: Implemented `IfStatement` and optimized `&&` / `||` to use bitwise instructions.

# Agent Response
I analyzed the codebase and found that `IfStatement` was missing from `src/compiler/statement.ts`. I implemented `IfStatement` using the Wasm `if` instruction. I also implemented `BinaryExpression` support for logical AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) in `src/compiler/expression.ts`.

To address the specific request "use and instead of nested if", I implemented `&&` using `i32.and` (and `||` using `i32.or`) on unboxed `i31` values. This avoids generating nested `if` blocks for logical operations, producing flatter and more compact WAT code.

I verified the changes by:
1.  Creating a reproduction script `scratch/test_if.js` with `if (1 && 1) ...`.
2.  Compiling it with a new helper `scripts/compile_one.ts` and confirming the WAT output uses `i32.and` inside a single `if` condition.
3.  Running existing tests via `scripts/run_testdata.ts` to ensure no regressions (all passed).
