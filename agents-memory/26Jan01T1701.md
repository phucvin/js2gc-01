Summary: Add a WAT example for a simple OOP dynamic typed language using Wasm GC, focusing on field access, method calls, and dynamic modification.

# User Prompt

add to wat examples a test to demo how a simple oop dynamic typed language can be compiled to Wasm GC

focus on field access and method call, including adding field/method to an existing object

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response

I will create a new WAT file `scratch/use_wat/simple_oop.wat` that implements a basic object system. I will implement a dynamic object structure (likely using an association list or simple map for properties) to allow adding fields and methods at runtime. I will then verify it by running the test runner.

# Update

I implemented `simple_oop.wat` with `get_field`, `set_field`, and `call_method` helpers. It uses a linked list for dynamic property storage. I successfully verified it with `node --experimental-wasm-stringref dist/run.js` which output `30` (10 + 20).
