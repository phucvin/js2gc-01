Summary: Optimized compiler to remove unnecessary `return` and `drop` instructions for `console.log` and `put_field` (property assignment).

# User Prompt
remove unnecessary return and drop, for example console.log doesn't need to return anything
put_field also doesn't need to return anything

# Agent Response
I implemented this by:
1.  **Refactoring `$console_log` and `$put_field`**: Modified these internal runtime helper functions in `src/compiler/index.ts` to return void (removing `(result anyref)` and the final `local.get`).
2.  **Context-Aware Compilation**: Updated `compileExpression` in `src/compiler/expression.ts` to accept a `dropResult` flag.
    -   When `dropResult` is true (e.g., in a statement context), the compiler generates direct void calls to `$console_log` and `$put_field`, and uses `local.set` for variable assignments, avoiding redundant `(drop)` instructions.
    -   When `dropResult` is false (e.g., in an expression context), the compiler wraps these calls in logic to preserve the return value (e.g., using `local.tee` and temporary locals for assignments, or explicit blocks for `console.log`).
3.  **Statement Propagation**: Updated `compileStatement` and `compileBody` in `src/compiler/statement.ts` to propagate the `dropResult` flag down to expressions, ensuring that statements in a block (except potentially the last one) are compiled as void operations.

Verified the changes by running the full test suite (`scripts/run_testdata.ts`) and a custom test case (`test_assign.js`) covering both statement and expression usage patterns.
