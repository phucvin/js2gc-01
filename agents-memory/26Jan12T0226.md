Summary: Removed unnecessary `return` and `drop` instructions from generated WebAssembly code. Specifically, modified `$console_log` to return void, and updated `compileExpression`, `compileStatement`, and `compileBody` to support a `dropResult` flag. This allows statements that don't need to return a value (like `console.log` in statement position) to avoid generating extra stack values and `drop` instructions, resulting in cleaner and more efficient WAT code. Verified the changes with existing test data and a custom test case.

# User Prompt
remove unnecessary return and drop, for example console.log doesn't need to return anything

# Agent Response
I will implement this by:
1.  Modifying the `$console_log` helper function in `src/compiler/index.ts` to return nothing (void).
2.  Updating `compileExpression` in `src/compiler/expression.ts` to support a `dropResult` flag. If `true`, it will generate void-returning code for `console.log` and drop-wrapped code for other expressions.
3.  Updating `compileStatement` and `compileBody` in `src/compiler/statement.ts` to utilize `dropResult`, avoiding the generation of `(drop)` instructions in the statement loop, and instead ensuring statements themselves produce no value when not needed.
