# Agent Response
Completed the following improvements:
1.  **Refactoring `src/compiler`**:
    *   Extracted runtime WAT generation logic from `src/compiler/index.ts` to a new `src/compiler/runtime.ts` module.
    *   Modularized `src/compiler/expression.ts` by splitting it into `src/compiler/expressions/` with separate handlers for literals, binary ops, calls, and functions (`literal.ts`, `binary.ts`, `call.ts`, `function.ts`). `src/compiler/expression.ts` remains as a re-export entry point.
2.  **Automation and Scripts**:
    *   Created `scripts/utils.ts` to house shared logic for compiling and running Wasm.
    *   Refactored `scripts/run_testdata.ts` and `scripts/run_benchmark.ts` to utilize `scripts/utils.ts`, reducing code duplication.
    *   Added `eslint` and `prettier` configuration files (`.eslintrc.json`, `.prettierrc`) and corresponding scripts (`lint`, `format`) to `package.json`.
3.  **Documentation**:
    *   Created `docs/architecture.md` detailing the compilation pipeline, object model, and the strategy for a Shared Runtime Module.
    *   Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` with guidelines for development, testing, and adding features.
4.  **Feature & Performance**:
    *   Added `.github/workflows/test.yml` for CI/CD to run linting and tests on PRs.

Verified all changes by running `npm test` (executing `scripts/run_testdata.ts`), which confirmed that all existing test cases pass with the refactored code.
