Summary: Initial plan to support function properties and method calls on objects.

# User Prompt

support adding function to object, and call it

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response

I will create a reproduction test case to verify the current behavior of adding a function to an object and calling it.
Then I will update the compiler to support this if it is not already supported.
