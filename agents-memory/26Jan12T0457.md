Summary: Implemented "Short-Circuiting Logic in Inline Caches" optimization by modifying `$add_cached` in `src/compiler/index.ts` to use nested `if` blocks instead of `i32.and`. Verified with tests and WAT inspection. Updated `docs/potential-optimizations-02.md` to reflect the change.

# User Prompt
implement one any possible optimization in docs/

update the doc as well

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I will implement the "Short-Circuiting Logic in Inline Caches" optimization described in `docs/potential-optimizations-02.md`. This involves replacing eager `i32.and` checks with short-circuiting control flow in runtime helpers like `$add_cached`. I will also update the documentation upon completion.

# Actions
1.  Analyzed `docs/potential-optimizations-02.md` and selected "Short-Circuiting Logic in Inline Caches".
2.  Verified the current implementation in `src/compiler/index.ts`.
3.  Modified `$add_cached` in `src/compiler/index.ts` to use nested `if` instructions.
4.  Ran `scripts/run_testdata.ts` to verify no regressions. All tests passed.
5.  Inspected `testdata/add.wat` to confirm the generated code uses nested `if`s.
6.  Updated `docs/potential-optimizations-02.md` to mark the optimization as implemented.
