Summary: Optimize inline cache for property access to use global variables instead of locals.

# User Prompt
optimize inline cache to be global and also init at global

# Agent Response
I will optimize the inline cache implementation by moving the call site cache from a local variable to a global variable. This involves:
1. Identifying the current property access implementation in `src/compiler/expression.ts`.
2. Modifying `src/compiler/context.ts` to support allocating global variables for call sites.
3. Updating the compilation logic to use these globals.
4. Ensuring proper initialization.
