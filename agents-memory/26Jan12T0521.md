Summary: Initial plan to implement redundant type cast optimization (ref.as_non_null).

# User Prompt
implement one any possible optimization in docs/

update the doc as well

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I have chosen to implement the "Redundant Type Casts (ref.as_non_null)" optimization from `docs/potential-optimizations-02.md`.
I will search for usage of `ref.as_non_null` in `src/compiler/`, create a reproduction test case, implement the optimization to avoid emitting the cast when the operand is already non-nullable, verify the fix, and update the documentation.
