Summary: Supporting function calls in JS-to-Wasm compiler.

# User Prompt
support more functions in js

main can call another function and return their return value

# Agent Response
I will implement support for function calls in the compiler.
- I will modify `src/compiler.ts` to iterate over all function declarations.
- I will generate WAT for each function.
- I will handle `CallExpression` to generate `call $funcName` instructions.
- I will assume for now that all functions return `anyref` and take no arguments, consistent with the current prototype.
