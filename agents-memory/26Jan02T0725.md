Summary: Modify global callsite initialization to be inline instead of using a separate initialization function.

# User Prompt

init globals for callsite inline, no need to have function to init globals

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response

I will explore the codebase to locate where global call sites are defined and initialized, then modify the generation logic to initialize them inline. I will also ensure I follow the `AGENTS.md` guidelines by logging this interaction.
