# Agent Response
I have implemented support for the `+` operator in the compiler, specifically handling addition of 31-bit integers (`i31ref`).
I created a test case `testdata/add.js` which defines `a()` returning 1 and `b()` returning 2, and `main` returning `a() + b()`.
The compiler now generates a helper function `$add` that performs the addition if the operands are `i31ref`. It includes checks for both operands to be `i31ref` to avoid runtime crashes.
The test passes with result `3`.
I also verified that existing tests pass.
