Summary: Added benchmark folder and script, and implemented missing compiler features (IfStatement, MinusToken) to support Fibonacci benchmark.

# User Prompt
add benchmark folder to compare run duration of compiled Wasm with JS inside nodejs/v8

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I will add a benchmark folder and a script to run benchmarks, comparing the performance of the compiled Wasm against the original JavaScript running in Node.js. I will also log this interaction in this file.

# Actions
1.  Created `benchmark/` folder.
2.  Created `benchmark/fib.js` with a recursive Fibonacci implementation.
3.  Created `scripts/run_benchmark.ts` to compile and run the benchmark, measuring execution time for both Wasm and JS.
4.  Encountered compilation errors due to missing `MinusToken` and `IfStatement` support in the compiler.
5.  Implemented `MinusToken` in `src/compiler/expression.ts` (basic `i31` subtraction).
6.  Implemented `IfStatement` in `src/compiler/statement.ts` (generating Wasm `if` with `anyref` result).
7.  Fixed stack overflow in `fib.js` by reducing input size from 30 to 20, then realized 30 is fine after fixes, but eventually settled on 30.
8.  Verified the benchmark runs successfully and produces comparable results (Wasm is significantly faster due to unoptimized JS execution or optimized Wasm path for small ints).

# Learnings
-   The compiler lacked basic control flow (`if`) and arithmetic (`-`) support, which are essential for even simple benchmarks like Fibonacci.
-   `console.log` is compiled to `print` helpers which are intercepted by the runner.
-   `run_benchmark.ts` follows the pattern of `run_testdata.ts` but adds timing and JS execution via `vm`.
