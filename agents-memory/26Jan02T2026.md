Summary: Updated subtraction implementation to use polymorphic inline caching ("similar to add") and ran benchmarks.

# User Prompt

do subtract similar to add

# Agent Response

I will implement subtraction using the same cached dispatch mechanism as addition, supporting both integers and floats.

# Actions

1.  Updated `src/compiler/index.ts` to include runtime helpers for subtraction:
    - `$sub_cached`: The main entry point using a `CallSite` global.
    - `$sub_slow`: The fallback logic handling type checking and dispatch.
    - `$sub_i32_i32`, `$sub_f64_f64`, etc.: Specialized implementation functions.
    - Registered these functions in `(elem declare func ...)`.
2.  Updated `src/compiler/expression.ts` to use `(call $sub_cached ...)` for `MinusToken` instead of the previous inline `i32` subtraction.
3.  Verified the fix by running `scripts/run_benchmark.ts`.
4.  Verified no regressions by running `scripts/run_testdata.ts`.

# Learnings

- Implementing binary operators "similar to add" requires a full suite of runtime helpers (`_cached`, `_slow`, specific implementations) to support polymorphism (i32/f64) and inline caching.
- The benchmark script successfully validates both correctness (output match) and performance (Wasm is ~9x faster for recursive fib).
