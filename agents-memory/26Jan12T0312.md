Summary: Updated `$console_log` and `$put_field` to return void. Refactored the compiler's `expression.ts` to wrap `console.log` calls in blocks returning null, and to use temporary locals for assignments to preserve values. Verified changes by running `scripts/run_testdata.ts` which updated golden files.

# User Prompt
console_log and put_field don't need to return anything

# Agent Response
I am proceeding with the plan to:
1. Modify `src/compiler/index.ts` to change `$console_log` and `$put_field` to return void.
2. Modify `src/compiler/expression.ts` to handle the void return type by wrapping `console.log` calls and preserving assignment values using temporary locals.
3. Verify changes with `scripts/run_testdata.ts`.

I have executed the plan:
- Updated `src/compiler/index.ts` to remove return types/values from `$console_log` and `$put_field`.
- Updated `src/compiler/expression.ts` to:
    - Wrap `console.log` calls in `(block (result anyref) (call ...) (ref.null any))`.
    - Handle assignments by saving RHS to a temp local before calling `$put_field`, then returning the local.
    - Remove `(drop)` after `$put_field` in postfix unary expressions.
- Ran `scripts/run_testdata.ts` which successfully updated the WAT files.
    - Verified that `add.wat` output (flattened block) is semantically correct.
- Updated this memory file.
