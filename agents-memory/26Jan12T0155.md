Summary: Analyzed WAT files in testdata for potential optimizations and documented findings in `docs/potential-optimizations.md`.

# User Prompt
read wat files in testdata to identify potential optimizations (remove redundancy, duplication)

write the detailed findings into docs/potential-optimizations.md

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I analyzed several WAT files (`add.wat`, `closure.wat`, `method_call.wat`, `loop_field_access.wat`, `object_literal.wat`).
I identified several areas for optimization:
- Redundant runtime helper definitions in every file.
- Inefficient string and object literal construction.
- Extensive use of temporary locals instead of the stack.
- Redundant type casts (`ref.as_non_null`).
- Redundant string allocations in `console.log`.

I wrote the detailed findings to `docs/potential-optimizations.md`.
