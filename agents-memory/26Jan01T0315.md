Summary: Temporarily skipping optimization in WAT examples runner.

# User Prompt
in wat examples, temporary skip optimize module

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I will modify `wat_examples/run.ts` to comment out the `module.optimize()` call, effectively skipping the optimization step for the WAT examples. This is being done as per the user's request. I have also created this memory file to log the interaction as required by `AGENTS.md`.
