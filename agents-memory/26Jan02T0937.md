Summary: Implemented inline caching for binary operators (specifically `+`) to optimize arithmetic operations with mixed types (i32, f64). Added `$BinaryOpCallSite` and `$BinaryOpFunc` types, specialized addition functions, and runtime helpers `$add_cached` and `$add_slow`. Updated `compileExpression` to use these helpers. Fixed a regression where unsupported types caused a crash by adding `$add_unsupported`. Verified with `binary_cache.js` and existing tests.

# Agent Response
I will implement inline caching for binary operators in the compiler, similar to how it's done for property access. I'll start by analyzing the current implementation and the example `dynamic_04.wat` which demonstrates this optimization.
