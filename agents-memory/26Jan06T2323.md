Summary: New session started to update README with feature checklist.
Analyzed the codebase (`src/compiler/statement.ts`, `src/compiler/expression.ts`, `src/compiler/index.ts`, and `testdata/`) to determine the implementation status of 20 key JavaScript features.
Updated `README.md` with a "Feature Checklist" reflecting the current status (e.g., variables, basic types, and functions are implemented; while loops and string operations are not).

# User Prompt

# Agent Response
I will analyze the codebase to identify implemented features and then update the README.md with the requested checklist.
