Summary: Implemented optimization for redundant instruction removal (drop (ref.null none)) and added NullKeyword/BooleanKeyword support.

# Agent Response
I identified an optimization opportunity in `docs/potential-optimizations-02.md` regarding redundant instructions (`(drop (ref.null none))`).

I implemented the following changes in `src/compiler/expression.ts`:
1.  Added support for `NullKeyword`, `TrueKeyword`, and `FalseKeyword`, mapping them to `(ref.null any)`, `(ref.i31 1)`, and `(ref.i31 0)` respectively.
2.  Modified `compileExpressionValue` to use a `fallbackPure` helper for side-effect-free expressions (literals, identifiers, null, this). If `dropResult` is true (meaning the value is not used), it emits `(nop)` instead of generating the value and dropping it.
3.  Updated `compileExpression` to correctly propagate `dropResult` logic.

I verified the changes by:
1.  Creating a reproduction case `scratch/drop_test.js` containing only expression statements (`null;`, `1;`, `this;`).
2.  Compiling it and verifying the output WAT contains `(nop)` or optimized sequences instead of `(drop ...)`.
3.  Running `scripts/run_testdata.ts` to ensure no regressions in existing tests.

I updated `docs/potential-optimizations-02.md` to reflect that this optimization has been implemented.
