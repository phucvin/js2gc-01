Summary: Refactoring compiler.ts into multiple files based on AST node types.

# User Prompt

refactor compiler to multiple files, each handling different ast node type

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response

I will refactor `src/compiler.ts` by splitting it into smaller files, each responsible for compiling a specific type of AST node. I will also ensure I follow the `AGENTS.md` instructions by logging this interaction.

# User Prompt

run testdata

# Agent Response

I ran `scripts/run_testdata.ts` and confirmed that all 8 examples in `testdata` processed successfully.
