# Agent Response
I have modified `src/compiler/index.ts` to replace the nested `if` structure in `$add_cached` with `i32.and` to evaluate both type checks in a single condition. This aligns with the user's request for cleaner and potentially more efficient Wasm code.

I verified the changes by running `scripts/run_testdata.ts`, which compiles and executes all test cases in `testdata/`. All tests passed, confirming that the change did not introduce any regressions.

The `AGENTS.md` instructions were followed by creating this session file (`agents-memory/26Jan02T2029.md`) and logging the interaction.
