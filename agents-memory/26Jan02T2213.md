Summary: Refactoring scratch/wat_interpreter to use multiple files.

# User Prompt
refactor scratch interpreter to use multiple files (.h and .cpp) for each component/class

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I will refactor the `scratch/wat_interpreter` to split `main.cpp` into separate header and source files for each class/component. I will also ensure that I follow the instructions in `AGENTS.md`, which includes maintaining this memory log.

I have completed the refactoring. `main.cpp` was split into:
- Shared headers: `utils.h`, `token.h`, `sexpr.h`, `ir.h`, `runtime_value.h`.
- Component modules: `lexer.h/.cpp`, `sparser.h/.cpp`, `compiler.h/.cpp`, `vm.h/.cpp`.
- `main.cpp` was updated to include these components.
- `build.sh` was updated to compile all source files.

I verified the changes by compiling and running a test WAT file `test_print.wat`.
