Summary: Implemented specific Binaryen optimization passes (`remove-unused-brs`, `remove-unused-names`, `remove-unused-module-elements`) in `src/compiler/index.ts` to strip unused code from the final WAT without applying full optimizations like constant propagation. Verified that unused functions (e.g., runtime helpers) are removed from the generated WAT in `testdata`.

# User Prompt
apply specifc binaryen optimization to remove unused things in the final WAT

but do not optimize all the way like doing constant propagation

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I will apply specific Binaryen passes to remove unused elements (like `remove-unused-brs`, `remove-unused-names`, `remove-unused-module-elements`) in the compiler pipeline, while ensuring full optimizations like constant propagation are not enabled.
