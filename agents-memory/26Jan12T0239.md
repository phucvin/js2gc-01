Summary: Initial plan to analyze WAT files for potential optimizations.

# User Prompt

read all wat files in testdata to identify more potential optimizations (e.g. short circuit instead of bitwise and)

write the detailed findings into docs/potential-optimizations-02.md

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response

I will start by listing the files in `testdata` and then reading the `.wat` files to identify optimization opportunities. I will focus on:

1. Short-circuiting logic opportunities (replacing `i32.and` with `if/block`).
2. Redundant instructions (e.g., `local.set` followed by `local.get`).
3. Unnecessary boxing/unboxing.
4. Unused code.

I will then document these findings in `docs/potential-optimizations-02.md`.
