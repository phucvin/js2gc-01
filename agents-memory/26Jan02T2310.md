Summary: Updated benchmark instructions to compile TS to JS before execution, updated `fib.js` to `fib(30)`, and reran benchmarks updating `README.md`. Also updated imports to use `.js` extension for ESM compatibility and adjusted scripts to run from `dist/`.

# User Prompt
update run instructions for benchmark to compile ts to js first, then run the built js

update benchmark fib to fib(30)

rerun benchmark and update result in readme

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I analyzed the codebase and identified that the project uses `ts-node` for execution. To support compiling to JS first, I updated all relative imports in `src/` and `scripts/` to use `.js` extensions, which is required for TypeScript ESM output. I created a `tsconfig.build.json` to handle compilation to `dist/`. I updated `scripts/run_benchmark.ts` and `scripts/run_testdata.ts` to correctly locate the project root when running from `dist/`. I updated `benchmark/fib.js` to calculate `fib(30)` instead of `fib(40)`. I compiled the project and ran the benchmark, updating `README.md` with the new results and usage instructions. I also updated the test instructions in `README.md` to match the new compilation workflow.
