Summary: Updated compiler to support `test` function and `console.log` with type dispatching. Updated test data and runner.

# User Prompt

add test function to each testdata js file that call console.log(main())

handle that in the compiler to call host functions to print i32, f64 or stringref depending on the type of the argument (i.e. do ref checks)

the test runner now call the test function, not the main function

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response

I updated `src/compiler.ts` to export the `test` function and implement `console.log` support. `console.log` now compiles to a call to a helper function `$console_log` which uses `ref.test` to check the argument type (`i31ref`, `$BoxedI32`, `$BoxedF64`, `$BoxedString`) and dispatches to injected host functions (`print_i32`, `print_f64`, `print_string`).

I updated all JS files in `testdata` (except `run.js`) to include `export function test() { console.log(main()); }`.

I updated `testdata/run.ts` to execute the `test` function instead of `main`, inject the print functions, and capture their output to the `.out` files.

I verified the changes by running the test runner, which successfully compiled and executed all examples, producing the expected output.
