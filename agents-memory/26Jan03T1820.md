Summary: Removed `stringref` and `enableStringRef` flag, replacing strings with `array i8`.

# User Prompt
remove stringref and flag controlling it

use array i8 for string instead

also follow agents.md

# Agent Response
I removed the `enableStringRef` option from `src/compiler/context.ts` and the associated logic in `src/compiler/index.ts`. I redefined `$String` as `(array (mut i8))` and updated `$BoxedString` to wrap this new type. I modified `src/compiler/expression.ts` to compile string literals into `array.new_fixed` instructions using UTF-8 byte values. I updated `scripts/run_benchmark.ts` and `scripts/run_testdata.ts` to remove the `binaryen.Features.Strings` flag and to handle printing of the new array-based strings (currently printing `[String]` as a placeholder). I verified the changes by running `scripts/run_benchmark.ts` and `scripts/run_testdata.ts`, confirming that compilation and execution proceed correctly.

Summary: Removed `BoxedString` wrapper and switched to `array i8` for strings. Added `print_char` host function to support printing string content character-by-character.

# User Prompt
BoxedString seems unnecessary

add print_char host function so string content can be printed

add new files to agents-memory, do not replace old files with new content

# Agent Response
I refactored the compiler to remove the `$BoxedString` struct and use `(ref $String)` (which is `(ref (array (mut i8)))`) directly. I updated `src/compiler/index.ts` to replace the `print_string` import with `print_char` and implemented a helper function `$print_string_helper` in Wasm to iterate over the string array and print characters individually. I updated `console_log` to use this helper for strings and objects (which print fixed strings like "[object Object]"). I also updated `src/compiler/expression.ts` to generate `array.new_fixed` directly for string literals. Finally, I updated `scripts/run_benchmark.ts`, `scripts/run_testdata.ts`, and `scripts/run_scratch_use_wat.ts` to implement the `print_char` host function. Verification confirms that strings are now printed correctly character-by-character (e.g., `hello world`), and existing benchmarks pass.
