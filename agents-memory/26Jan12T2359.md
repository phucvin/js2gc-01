Summary: Configured project to run tests and benchmarks using native TypeScript support via `ts-node`. Updated `package.json` with `test` and `benchmark` scripts, installed dependencies, and updated `README.md` to reflect the new simplified usage. Verified changes by running both tests and benchmarks successfully.

# User Prompt

run test and benchmark with native typescript support

# Agent Response

I've updated `package.json` to include `test` and `benchmark` scripts that run the TypeScript test and benchmark runners directly using `ts-node` (with ESM support).

- `npm test`: Runs `scripts/run_testdata.ts` which compiles and executes tests in `testdata/`.
- `npm run benchmark`: Runs `scripts/run_benchmark.ts` which executes benchmarks in `benchmark/` and updates `README.md` with results.

I also updated `README.md` to reflect these new simplified commands.
I verified that both commands run successfully.
