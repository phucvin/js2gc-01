# Agent Response
I have updated `scratch/js_interpreter/main.cpp` to correctly use `Lexer`, `Parser`, and `Evaluator` classes from their respective header files. I also extracted the `Evaluator` class into new files `vm.h` and `vm.cpp`, and created a shared `value.h` header for the `Value` struct.

1.  Created `value.h` to define `struct Value`.
2.  Created `vm.h` and `vm.cpp` to implement the `Evaluator` class.
3.  Updated `main.cpp` to include the new headers and removed the inline class definitions.
4.  Updated `build.sh` to compile and link all component files (`main.cpp`, `lexer.cpp`, `parser.cpp`, `vm.cpp`).
5.  Verified the changes by compiling and running a test JavaScript file (`test.js`), which produced the expected output.
